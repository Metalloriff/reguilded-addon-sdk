# Unofficial ReGuilded Addon SDK

### Create addons using JavaScript/TypeScript with JSX/TSX and Sass/SCSS support.
### Includes a WIP library with some useful functions and classes.

# Getting started
### First download the repo, and install its dependencies by running
    npm i
### or
    yarn add

### Then, if you'd like, check out the example addon in `src/ExampleAddon`.
### And you can start this addon by running
    npm start --addon=ExampleAddon
### NOTE - You will need to add `ExampleAddon` to your enabled plugins list in `%AppData%\Roaming\.reguilded\settings\settings.json`

###### This SDK is in development, more will be added as I find time
